ONNX Conversion Notice:

This repository contains ONNX-format derivatives of the VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B
model, originally developed by Microsoft Research and released under the MIT
License at https://huggingface.co/microsoft/VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B.

The ONNX export was performed by Bruno Capuano as part of the vibevoice-labs
project (https://github.com/elbruno/vibevoice-labs). The conversion preserves
the original model's functionality in ONNX format for cross-platform inference.
